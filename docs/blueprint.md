## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#F7941D) to convey energy and savings. This color aligns with the brand's original color and symbolizes the power and warmth of solar energy.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F4F4F4), near-white to create a clean and modern feel, matching the original color scheme and enhancing readability.
- Accent color: Bright blue (#00B1E5) for interactive elements and CTAs, complementing the primary orange and signaling trustworthiness.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use of vector-style graphics that are illustrated. Each section will be clearly segmented with appropriate spacing and visual cues, like original site's 'playful yet professional look'.
- Custom icons for each section (costs, savings, ROI) to visually enhance understanding.
- Subtle hover effects on buttons and interactive elements to improve user experience.
